This is my second try on to-do app.

- no dependencies, simply Vanilla JS;

## App Features:

- see current local date above input field;
- add to-do by typing into the input field and pressing 'Enter';
- mark to-do as 'completed';
- delete to-do from the list by clicking respective icon;
- all to-do's saved to local storage and will be retrieved if the page is
  reloaded;
- local storage memory may be cleared from all stored to-do's by clicking
  'reload button' at the top right corner of the app;
